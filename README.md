# Worldline-Quantum-Monte-Carlo
I tried to implement a Worldline Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for the Heisenberg Model in C++, but for some reason the energy decreases with decreasing beta. I would be happy to get any help on this issue, but I know how miniscule the chance is.

The algorithm is based on the paper linked in this repository.

"main.exe" was compiled with clang++ 15.0.1 and requires Python 3 for it to properly work.
