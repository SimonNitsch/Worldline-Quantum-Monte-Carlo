# Worldline-Quantum-Monte-Carlo

I tried to implement a Worldline Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for the Heisenberg Model in C++, but for some reason the energy decreases with decreasing beta. I'm pretty sure that's not correct.

main.exe was compiled with clang++ 15.0.1 and requires Python 3 for it to properly work.

The algorithm is based on this paper: https://pawn.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/~assaad/Reprints/assaad_evertz.pdf
