# Worldline-Quantum-Monte-Carlo

I tried to implement a Worldline Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for the Heisenberg Model in C++, but for some reason the energy decreases with decreasing beta. I'm pretty sure that's not correct.

The algorithm is based on this paper: https://pawn.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/~assaad/Reprints/assaad_evertz.pdf
